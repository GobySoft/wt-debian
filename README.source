Repackaged source
=================

This version of Wt was downloaded as a big tarball from the Wt SourceForge site 
and repackaged as using uscan:

$ uscan --force-download --repack --verbose --watchfile debian/watch


jQuery and jPlayer
==================

Upstream's original tarball include jQuery and jPlayer.

The Debian package does NOT use them: jQuery and jPlayer are replaced by the 
Debian versions, which is the reason witty depends/build-depens on 
libjs-jquery and libjs-jquery-jplayer.


dpatch
======

This package uses dpatch(1) to manage all modifications to the upstream source.
Changes are stored in the source package as dpatch format diffs, and applied 
from debian/patches at build-time.

To get the fully patched source after unpacking the source package, cd to the 
root level of the source package and run:

	dpatch apply-all

To add new patches, first apply all existing patches, and then run:

	dpatch-edit-patch <patchname>

Dpatch opens a new shell in a copy of the source tree. Edit the files 
appropriately and then exit the shell, and dpatch will generate a file called 
debian/patches/<patchname>. To have new patches applied automatically during 
build and with dpatch apply-all, add <patchname> to debian/patches/00list.

To reverse all patching, run:

	dpatch deapply-all
