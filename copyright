   DEVELOPER-BASED COMMERCIAL LICENSE TERMS
   .
   Each developer which uses the Wt API requires a Commercial License during
   the entire development and maintenance period of the web application. The
   Developer-based Commercial Licenses are valid for the duration of one year,
   and for any released version of Wt.
   .
   There are no additional charges for distribution of the application, and the
   license allows the developer to work on an unlimited number of products.
   .
   The license may not be passed on between developers, unless permission is
   granted by Emweb.
   .
   Commercial licensed developers have access to the public community-driven
   mailing list for their support questions. A commercial license does not
   include guaranteed responses from Emweb's Wt developers, nor training. For
   support contracts, please consult our support offerings.
   .
   PROJECT-BASED COMMERCIAL LICENSE TERMS
   .
   As an alternative to the Developer-based Commercial License, a License may
   be purchased on a per-project basis. This License allows the usage of Wt by
   as many developers as necessary to complete a single pre-defined project.
   .
   There are usually no additional charges for distribution of the application.
   .
   Support options are usually negotiated together with the license. This
   guarantees, if required, personalized high-priority support in addition to
   the public, community-driven mailing lists.
